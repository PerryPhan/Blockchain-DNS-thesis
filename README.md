## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

At the beginning, suppose this program to be small one, which has only terminal and some web servers to test on. But it took me like 3 weeks to find out this is going massive. <br>
It can resolve any request <b> resolving domain from any where ( using 'ping', 'nslookup', 'dig', even in the browser ) </b>. The Data structure is Blockchain, decentralized network, start by CMD NODE to init. 

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database
- [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) - Server Framework
- [Python Socket](https://vuejs.org/) - Request and Response Flatform
- [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - Web Template

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
### <b> Prerequisites </b>
You must have Python in your PC to start program, my version is 
```
Python 3.9.5
```
Try with upper or equal version only. Because I had bug when hashing SHA 256 from database in hashlib in version 3.6.5

### <b> Installing </b>
All the setup process is in the setup.sh, you can just easily run batch and the database included a number of table data. 
```
setup.sh
```
Another need in this program is DNS Server config, go to dns/Server.py and rewrite bellow option

```
# Global variables
IP = '192.168.43.7' # wifi Ipv4 address
PORT = 53
```

And lanch these lines to generate restartNIC.bat based on above 'Global variables' ( -rw means rewriting file batch, find more with -h )
```
cd dns
python Server.py -p -rw 
```

The result with like restartNIC.sample.bat with Ipv4 is 192.168.43.7
